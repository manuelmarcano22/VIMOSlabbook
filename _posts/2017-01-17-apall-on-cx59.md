By looking at the pre-image with the region file, I assume that the first aperture (from top to bottom) corresponds to the brightest source CX59 (maybe saturated?). I also think that since the smaller fourth "slit"  in the SEXM file here is a standard start put by the pipeline, and that is why there are six "sections" in the SEXM file. Is this the correct interpretation of the data?

If the interpretation is correct in the SRFM file the last aperture on the SRFM (so the 16th row) would be that of CX59. I notice some similarity with Ap. 2 in the SRFM of CX0025. The one on the left corresponds to CX25 and on the right CX59.

They share some common features, but one big disagreement is around 8890 Angstrom. The presume cx59 has a big bump. 

Regarding CX59 [@TychoIdentification] says in section 6.14:

> 6.14. CX59 (CXOGBS J174500.5â€“261228)
> CX59 was matched with TYC 6832-663-1 with a quite large
> offset of 3.53 arcsec. This source was detected only 3 arcmin
> off-axis by Chandra with 27 photons, so there is no reason to
> expect such a large offset. This star has not been reported as a
> double, and the X-ray source is also the hardest of the sources
> considered here for which we can calculate a hardness ratio. We
> conclude that this is likely to be a chance alignment.
