## SREI

In the image below you can see two "stars". Does this corresponds to the two aperture associated with the slit?

In the picture below I assume that from the bottom up the second and third "aperture" are from the slit. Is my source the brightest one of the other one?

When I tried using apall with a copy of the SEXM file the apertures begin from bottom to top (I think, by looking at the dynamically finding the apertures). So for Ap 2 and 3 I get:

Where the top ones are from the SRFM and the bottom ones are not corrected running apall on the SEXM.

## CX 25 Information

## Simbad

Searching in Simbad using the location of Cx0025 (as given in the survey and not in the pre-image fount in [note.tex](https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/VIMOSReduced/blob/master/note.tex)) the closest match is **TYC 7381-792-1** [Query](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%407402272&Name=TYC%207381-792-1&submit=submit). It is inded a CXOGBS object with ID J174502.7-315934. 

In vizier you can look for the sources on catalogs like the X-ray survey of the Galactic Bulge [GBS catalog](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJS/210/18).

From there can have a view in many wavelength with [aladin](http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/?target=17%2045%202.780-31%2059%2035.00&fov=8.31&survey=JAXA%2FP%2FSWIFT_BAT_FLUX). See below

Searching on the Tycho stars I found this very relevant paper [@TychoIdentification]. Regarding CX25 it says:


> 6.8. CX25 (CXOGBS J174502.7â€“315934)
> TYC 7381-792-1 shows no detectable period, but does
> appear to exhibit irregular variability in ASAS data. The
> colors are consistent with a single star, with the JHK
> colors suggesting an early K main-sequence or late G
> giant type. It has a high X-ray to optical flux ratio and
> quite hard spectrum (like CX10 and 12). It is likely an
> active single star or binary


After identifying the right spectra to work with I can use the following resources to understand the spectra:


- http://www.unitronitalia.com/prodotti/analysis-and-interpretation-of-astronomical-sp.pdf on page 86

- A DIGITAL SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION ATLAS: http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Gray/frames.html

-  http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ASS_Atlas/frames.html

- [Common lines](http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~msw/lines.html)

- [Helium Lines tables](http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/Tables/heliumtable2.htm)

I found a nice book of stellar spectral classification [@SpectralClassBook]


### NIR lines

If the second aperture on the SRFM is indded the correct spectra we can look at the NIR to see if we can find some Ca II triplets.

From [@SpectralClassBook] page 284 and citing [@Carquillat1997] to compare:

### Balmer Series

We see big absorption in H$\alpha$ and absorption at 6497 too.

#### For H$\beta$ at 4861 A

## To Do: Spectra Correction and Normalized

I need to ask if I need to do the correction with the link that Dr. Torre send me.

{% highlight python %}
sexm = fits.open('trySEXM.ms.fits')
r = fits.open('respo.fits')
sexminsert=np.insert(sexm[0].data[3],[0],[0]) # to include 0 zero
{% endhighlight %}


# The Other Aperture


If the source is the other object in the slit the spectra is plotted below. Contrary to the other object this one has emission in  H$\alpha$ at around 656.3 nm. For $H\beta$ at 486.1 nm there seems to be a tiny absorption. At 850 nm, 854.3, and 866.0 nm, there seem to be the three **Ca II Triplet**. And for the one at 854.3 nm there seems to be a tiny emission line. For the **Na I D** around 589.598 nm  line there is a strange profile maybe due to small emission, and for **Mg I b1** around 518.362 nm maybe also emission.  

About this [@SpectralClassBook] says:

> For solar-type stars the best indicators of stellar activity are the emissions in the cores of the Ca II H and K, in the core of H$\alpha$ line, and of Ca II triplet lines. In section 7.2.2 

Ca II H & K lines are outside my dataset being below 400 nm at 3968.468 (H) and 3933.663 (k) nm. 

### Other possible lines

I tried to find some of the lines mentioned in the "An Atlas of optical continuum and line emission from LMXB" [@Shahbaz1996]. At the end of the page there is an example from [Cen X-4](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=Cen+X-4&submit=SIMBAD+search) that according to [@Shahbaz1996] is an K5V spectral type with varius H, He and O lines. It is an LMXB.

At 940.4 there seems to be another emission line. Maybe from the Pashen series.

Regarding **Helium**. I am not sure if like the CVs Helium II and Helium I should be present. A table can be found [here](http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/Tables/heliumtable2.htm). Some Helium lines in the spectral range are:

#### Helium I

* He I: 492.1 nm 
* He I: 587.5 nm  (Maybe emission next to absorption)
* He I: 667.8 nm 

#### Helium II

* The strong He II line at 468.5 nm is out of range 

Need to look for **OIII** maybe. 

* OIII at 559.2 nm. Maybe tiny emission in absorption?
