## Morgan-Keenan System (MK System)

The *Atlas of Stellar Spectra* published in 1943 [@morgankeenan43] established the two-dimensional Morgan-Keena system of spectral classification. In this system a **Luminosity Class** ,designated by a Roman numeral, is appended to a star's Harvard spectral type. The numeral I is resered to supergiants and V for Main-sequence star. According to [@carroll2007] the ratio of the strenghts of two closely spaced linesis often employed to place a star in the limunosity class. 

> In general, for stars of the same spectral type, narrower lines are usually produced by more luminous stars. This is because the atmospheres of more luminous stars are less dense, there are fewer collisions between atoms. Collisions can distort the energies of atomic orbitals, leading to broadening of the spectral lines. [@carroll2007]

##  RS CVn stars

From [@starspot2005]

> RS CVn stars represent a class of close detached binaries with the more massive primary component being a G–K giant or subgiant and the secondary a subgiant or dwarf of spectral classes G to M. They show optical variability (outside eclipses) which is characterised by an amplitude up to 0.6 mag in the V band and interpreted as the rotationally modulated effect of cool spots on their surfaces. Because of low luminosity of the secondary many RS CVn systems appear as single line binaries class which is attractive for spectral analysis. In binaries, where both components can be observed, the primary appears more active than the secondary.

Proposed by [@hall76] with following signatures:

- photometric variability
- Ca II H and K emission lines
- subgiant component well within its Roche lobe
- fast rotation, i.e. almost synchronised binaries with orbital periods of a few days
- orbital period variations

> Thus, similar to other cool active stars, RS CVn-type variables are remarkable due to strong chromospheric plages, coronal X-ray, and microwave emissions, as well as strong flares in the optical, UV, radio, and X-ray. [...] Large amplitude brightness variations of RS CVn stars imply the presence of enormous starspots on their surfaces covering up to 50% of the visible disc [@starspot2005]


About these [@SpectralClassBook]  says:

> fit among the late-type active stars: Their hotter component is F- or G-type and luminosity class V or IV. [...] Often emission of $H\alpha$. There is an over weakening or veiling of lines including the Hydrogen one. not to to an abundance effect but to a non-normal temperature structure in its atmosphere.[...] Ex: determine type from line ratio of temperature-sensitive lines rather than from their absolute strength. 

## G- and K- type stars

From [@SpectralClassBook] page 266 chapter 7,  relevant for the VIMOS wavelength range:

> While early-G stars can be distinguished from late-G and K stars by the increase in absolute strength of the Fe I (8468,8514,8621,8688) and Ti I lines (8435), the disappearance of the Pascen series around G0 means that these hydrogen lines are not useful for ratios. The line Fe I 8621 stays fairly constant in dwarf stars over G-K types, but it is not near other strongly varying lines and so again is of little use. The ratio of Balmer $H\alpha$ with a blend at $\lambda 6497$ makes a good temperature discriminant. 


## A-Type Stars 

### Infrared:

From [@SpectralClassBook]:

> In the dwarf A-type stars, the outstanding spectral trend in this region is the changing appearance of the Paschen lines. In the early A-type stars, the Paschen lines are much stronger than the lines of the Ca II triplet, but in the later A-type stars, and in the F-type stars, the Ca II triplet begins to dominate. This leads to a distinctive pattern in which P13, P15, and P16 lines become increasingly strong relative to the neighboring unblended Paschen lines as one moves towards later types. In addition to this, the strenghts of the $H\alpha$ line and the Paschen lines in general decrease with declining temperature. The O I triplet is fairly insensitive to temperature in the A-type stars. 

Regarding main-sequence and supergiants:

> Luminosity sensitive features are Si II $\lambda6347,6371$, $H\alpha$, O I triplet. In the supergiants the Paschen lines are narrower, and the highest line visible is P22 or P23, whereass in the dwarfs, only P16 or P17 can be readily discerned. 


## Spectra Resources

### Books:
 - [@SpectralClassBook] 
 - [@1945table]

### Papers: 

- In [@atlaslow93] they present "We present spectra of O to M stars, luminosity classes V, III, and lb in the wavelength range 5800-8900 A, at approximately 15 A resolution." This is roughly the spectra resolution that I have. 
- [@carquillat97]: This Atlas illustrates the behavior of late type stars (F, G, K and M) in the near infrared 8400− 8800 A region with a resolution of about 2 A
- [@andrillat1995]: The Atlas illustrates the behavior of early type stars (O, B, A and F type) in the near infrared 8375-8770A region at a resolution of about one A.
- In [@danks1994]: An atlas of stellar spectra covering the wavelength range from 5800A to 10,200A is presented of 126 southern MK standard stars, covering the luminosity classes I, III, and V. Some peculiar stars are included for comparison purposes. The spectra were obtained at a resolution of 4.3A.
