## Morgan-Keenan System (MK System)

The *Atlas of Stellar Spectra* published in 1943 [@morgankeenan43] established the two-dimensional Morgan-Keena system of spectral classification. In this system a **Luminosity Class** ,designated by a Roman numeral, is appended to a star's Harvard spectral type. The numeral I is resered to supergiants and V for Main-sequence star. According to [@carroll2007] the ratio of the strenghts of two closely spaced linesis often employed to place a star in the limunosity class. 

> In general, for stars of the same spectral type, narrower lines are usually produced by more luminous stars. This is because the atmospheres of more luminous stars are less dense, there are fewer collisions between atoms. Collisions can distort the energies of atomic orbitals, leading to broadening of the spectral lines. [@carroll2007]

##  RS CVn stars

From [@starspot2005]

> RS CVn stars represent a class of close detached binaries with the more massive primary component being a G–K giant or subgiant and the secondary a subgiant or dwarf of spectral classes G to M. They show optical variability (outside eclipses) which is characterised by an amplitude up to 0.6 mag in the V band and interpreted as the rotationally modulated effect of cool spots on their surfaces. Because of low luminosity of the secondary many RS CVn systems appear as single line binaries class which is attractive for spectral analysis. In binaries, where both components can be observed, the primary appears more active than the secondary.

Proposed by [@hall76] with following signatures:

- photometric variability
- Ca II H and K emission lines
- subgiant component well within its Roche lobe
- fast rotation, i.e. almost synchronised binaries with orbital periods of a few days
- orbital period variations

> Thus, similar to other cool active stars, RS CVn-type variables are remarkable due to strong chromospheric plages, coronal X-ray, and microwave emissions, as well as strong flares in the optical, UV, radio, and X-ray. [...] Large amplitude brightness variations of RS CVn stars imply the presence of enormous starspots on their surfaces covering up to 50% of the visible disc [@starspot2005]


About these [@SpectralClassBook]  says:

> fit among the late-type active stars: Their hotter component is F- or G-type and luminosity class V or IV. [...] Often emission of $H\alpha$. There is an over weakening or veiling of lines including the Hydrogen one. not to to an abundance effect but to a non-normal temperature structure in its atmosphere.[...] Ex: determine type from line ratio of temperature-sensitive lines rather than from their absolute strength. 

## G- and K- type stars

From [@SpectralClassBook] page 266 chapter 7,  relevant for the VIMOS wavelength range:

> While early-G stars can be distinguished from late-G and K stars by the increase in absolute strength of the Fe I (8468,8514,8621,8688) and Ti I lines (8435), the disappearance of the Pascen series around G0 means that these hydrogen lines are not useful for ratios. The line Fe I 8621 stays fairly constant in dwarf stars over G-K types, but it is not near other strongly varying lines and so again is of little use. The ratio of Balmer $H\alpha$ with a blend at $\lambda 6497$ makes a good temperature discriminant. 


## A-Type Stars 

### Infrared:

From [@SpectralClassBook]:

> In the dwarf A-type stars, the outstanding spectral trend in this region is the changing appearance of the Paschen lines. In the early A-type stars, the Paschen lines are much stronger than the lines of the Ca II triplet, but in the later A-type stars, and in the F-type stars, the Ca II triplet begins to dominate. This leads to a distinctive pattern in which P13, P15, and P16 lines become increasingly strong relative to the neighboring unblended Paschen lines as one moves towards later types. In addition to this, the strenghts of the $H\alpha$ line and the Paschen lines in general decrease with declining temperature. The O I triplet is fairly insensitive to temperature in the A-type stars. 

Regarding main-sequence and supergiants:

> Luminosity sensitive features are Si II $\lambda6347,6371$, $H\alpha$, O I triplet. In the supergiants the Paschen lines are narrower, and the highest line visible is P22 or P23, whereass in the dwarfs, only P16 or P17 can be readily discerned. 

### B-type stars

In NIR have He I lines. 

## Paschen Jumps:

From [@atlaslow93]:

> It is clear from the figures that the Paschen area itself
gives a good first approximation of spectral type for early
type stars (O—F), especially for A stars. This is completely
analogous to the Balmer area in the blue part of the
spectrum. For early types, the Paschen area can also distinguish
supergiants from luminosity class V or III stars.
The Paschen lines in the supergiants are much narrower
than in giants or main-sequence stars, so more lines can be
resolved in the series. In addition, the O I A8446 line is a
good indicator of luminosity, as is the Paschen jump in A
stars. For the late types (G—M), the Paschen area alone
(i.e., the Ca II triplet) is a good indicator of luminosity

### Template Smoothing

The following  papers  will clue you in on the formal way to obtain spectral type determinations by subtracting template spectra to a target spectrum:

- [@Steeghs07]
- [@Torres02]

You have  template spectra with different resolution to that of your target. In this case, a way to smooth the template is using a Gaussian with FWHM:

$FWHM_{gaussian}^2 = FWHM_{vimos}^2  - FWHM_{template}^2$  

Other (more complex) way to do this is using a broadening profile as explained in [@Torres02]

To do this the Program called [Molly](http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/software/molly/html/INDEX.html) written by Tom Marsh from Warwick can be used. Some IRAF tools available for this task are in the KPNOSLT package, [dispcor](dispcor -- Dispersion correct and resample spectra) and [dopcor](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?dopcor). 

- dispcpr for dispersion correct and resample spectra
-  dopcor to apply doppler correction


### Fit continuum

First, try to cut the spectrum into two, a red and a blue part. 

> scopy cx0137cut.msc.fits 4750- 7565 cx0137bcut.msc.fits
> scopy cx0137cut.msc.fits 7723 - INDEF cx0137rcut.msc.fits

> scopy CX0044blue.ms.fits cx0044bluecut.msc.fits  4750 -indef
> scopy CX0044red.ms.fits cx0044redcut.msc.fits indef-indef  

In the blue then need to mask the emission lines and in the red one need to mask the telluric lines. For example for the red part for the sample do:


> continuum  input=cx0137rcut.msc.fits  output=cx0137rnv2.msc.fits  sample="6600:6800,7080:7140,7710:7870,8050:8090,8440:8910,8914:8916,
>	8922:8926,8970:8973,8981:8983,8985:8987,9056:9059,9201:9204,9219:9221,9226:9228,9910:10400"


the others parameters are the function to be fit to the spectra and the order of the polynomials or the number of spline pieces. So for example s3o2 means spline3 and order 2. Also the rejection limits below and above the fit in units of the resicual sigma. This are low_reject and high_reject. The advice from Dr. Torres is:

> Si tu continuo no tuviera ninguna absorcion o muy debiles, usarias lo_rej=high_rej=3. Sin embargo vas a tener lineas de absorcion con lo cual tendras que disminuir uno de estos dos  parametr para evitar que el ajuste se desplaze hacias las lineas de absorcion.

### Papers: 

- In [@atlaslow93] they present "We present spectra of O to M stars, luminosity classes V, III, and lb in the wavelength range 5800-8900 A, at approximately 15 A resolution." This is roughly the spectra resolution that I have. 
- [@carquillat97]: This Atlas illustrates the behavior of late type stars (F, G, K and M) in the near infrared 8400− 8800 A region with a resolution of about 2 A
- [@andrillat1995]: The Atlas illustrates the behavior of early type stars (O, B, A and F type) in the near infrared 8375-8770A region at a resolution of about one A.
- In [@danks1994]: An atlas of stellar spectra covering the wavelength range from 5800A to 10,200A is presented of 126 southern MK standard stars, covering the luminosity classes I, III, and V. Some peculiar stars are included for comparison purposes. The spectra were obtained at a resolution of 4.3A.
