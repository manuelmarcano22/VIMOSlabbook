### Conda

To list enviroments do:

`conda env list`

The one with pyraf installed is iraf27. To use it then do: `source activate iraf27`


This is using [astroconda](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It has python 2.7 with pyraf installed. 

### Pyraf

I was getting the error `IrafError: "Undefined variable uparm' in string ..."`. This is 2.10 in the [pyraff_faq](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyraf/pyraf_faq). This got solve by running mkiraf and selecting xterm. This will change from system to system. 

### CX0059

To make the region file just include the right path to the location of the `idradectotal.dat`. Then to make the region file you need the preimgq#.lis and spq#.lis. These can be created in pyraf with imheader. For the case of CX0059:

`imheader VI_SREI_453432_2010-08-16T00:07:49.410_R_Q2_lo.fits lo+ >> preimgq2.lis` 

or 

`imheader VI_SREI_453432_2010-04-02T09:04:40.063_R_Q2_lo.fits lo+ >> preimgq2.lis`

Since there are two preimages SREI. 

and for the spq2.lis do:

`imheader VI_SSEM_577734_2011-06-24T05:56:42.518_G475_MR_402230_Q4_hi.fits lo+ >> spq2.lis`

This creates a region file for quadrant 2. In ds9 for **SREI the 2011-08-16** we have:

![SREI 08]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cx59srei08.png)

For **2010-04-02**:

![SREI 04]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cx59srei04.png)


So there are 5 different slits. 

- CX59
- CX572
- CX1033
- CX 1032
- CX 172

## 2D Data

For this set the sky substracted 2D data is show below:

![SSEM-2011-05-26]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ssemcx59.png)

This data set included the automatically extracted and flux calibrated spectra SRFM.
