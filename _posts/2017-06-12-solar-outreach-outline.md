- Exploration of the Sun
	- [Helioviewer](https://www.helioviewer.org/): Anybody can be an Heliophysicists 
		- Options in HelioViewer:
			- Different Solar Missions. Why so many? They are at different orbits to see different parts of the Sun.Different instruments
				- SDO: Along wiht Stereo see whole Sun. Magnetism. 
				- SOHO: X-ray and EUV. Corona. At L1
				- STEREO Ahead and behind. See back of the SUn and 3D. See July 5 2009 Stereo A and B. EUVI. Not only can see Sun see satrun.  2010-12-03 SOHO LOSCO C3
			- Why we want to see at different wavelenghts?
				- Different elements and different layers of the Sun different elements emit diffenet wavenlenth. Relate this to lamps. 
			- Magnetic fields?
				- How do we know they are there? How do we mesure them?  Sunspots are magnetic?
					- Using spectra and Zeeman effect. 
				- How do we know Sunpots are really at the Surface of the Sun? 
				- Sunspots. What do we notice?
					- They are dynamic. Average lifetime? From months to hours. Check it.Longer than rotation of the Sun of 35 days. Can help us look at the differential rotation of the SUn. What is the period of the rot of the Sun? 
					- different polarity. Polarity north and Sun. 2005/12/15
					- Tell us about the Solar cycle. We are in Cycle 25. When do we know?  Cycle 25 2016/12/20 and north balck-white 2017/01/27. Change in polarity of the Sun. Different at different latitudes. Cycle 24 bornd 08/01/04
					- What else we see?
						- Granules. Convection. So no convection in sunspot so cooler or hotter?
		- The dynamic Sun:
			- Flares. hallowen storm on. Fried the detectors od SOHO. Noise. 
			- Space weather. What happens on earth?
			- Can oyu measure the speed and their size?

		- Homework:
			- Measure rotation of the sun
			- Measure differential rotaion. Use SDO HMI for this or active regions
			- Start and beginning of cycles. Average lenght?
			- What cycle when you were born?
			- How many sunspots
			- SPeed of coronal mass ejection
			- What happnes e
