In the folder name [CX191](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx191). There are two other sources close. Maybe left-rigt is top to bottom.

- CX706: Only one bright source in the middle. Seems to be the section from 120 to 170. 
- CX701: It is the second one between 50 and 120
- CX191: From 0 to 50. There are at least three stars in that section. 


# CX191

In [@TychoIdentification] it is mentioned CX191:

> In performing our optical matches, we identified two cases
where two of the X-ray sources appear to coincide with the same
Tycho star. In both cases, the two X-ray sources were detected
in different images, and one has a much larger off-axis angle
than the other, and consequently less precise coordinates. In
these cases, we believe that they are duplicate detections of the
same source, with position differences just too large for Jonker
et al. (2011) to have identified them as duplicates. **The redundant
sources are CX191**, which appears to have been an off-axis detection
of CX360, and CX230, which appears to be an off-axis
detection of CX33.

Also 

> CX360 lies 4.07 arcsec from TYC 6840-525-1. **CX191** also
appears to be an off-axis detection of this source.
