The [folder](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359) with CX 359 has 4 sources in the same field: CX 644, CX 359, CX 950 and CX 953. In the preimage left to right translate to  decreasing y (top to bottom) in the SEXM. We have going from y equal 0 to 150:

- CX953: 0 to 50. There are at least two sources. One brighter thought the whole spectral range center at around [30](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=30&low=-5&high=5). The second one center around [17](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=17&low=-5&high=5).

- CX950: 50 to 70. It is smaller than the other three. It has a very bright start to the right, so at the bottom of the slit in the SEXM around [63](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=63&low=-5&high=5). Then a brighter one around [55](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=55&low=-5&high=5). and a third small one in the left (up in SEXM). Hard to get spectra since close to the border. 

- CX359: 70 to 120. It has the brightest object. This looks like two object. Look at Aperture: 2060 and you have two peaks. One at [96](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=96&low=-5&high=5) and other at [105](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=105&low=-5&high=5). At aperture 2060 also it seems to be one object at [80](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=55&low=-5&high=5). 


- CX 644: 120 to 150. There are at least two faint sources. There are two peaks one at [136](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=136&low=-5&high=2) and other fainter at around [140](https://vimos.manuelpm.me/cx359?center=140&low=-2&high=5).
