## My Setup

### The university Server

The server at the physics department I have access to is _krieger.ttu.edu_ and my username _mmarcano_. When connected to the university network can use ssh as:

`ssh mmarcano@krieger.ttu.edu`

For **remote access**

`ssh -L 2222:krieger.ttu.edu:22 mapichar@ssh.ttu.edu`

The instruction on how to do that can be found [here](https://askit.ttu.edu/portal/app/portlets/results/viewsolution.jsp?SToken=BE61C2DC4FE5B4CC9919A11B48D6056B&solutionid=160504120603124&hypermediatext=null).

After establishing the connection thought _ssh.ttu.edu_ in my localhost I can scp and ssh as:

`scp -P 2222 mmarcano@localhost:~/krieger.* .`

and

`ssh -p 2222 mmarcano@localhost`

### Jupyter notebooks

[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) is installed and I can run [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks. In the server I first do:

`jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8890`

And then in my computer

`ssh -N -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 mmarcano@krieger.ttu.edu`

The idea was taken from this [website](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh).

To connect from out of campus can do like  above:

```bash
ssh -L 2222:archer.ttu.edu:22 mapichar@ssh.ttu.edu
```
In archer/krieger then do: 

`jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8890`

and in my local machine:

`ssh -N -L localhost:8890:localhost:8890 -p 2222 mmarcano@localhost`

Then I can just open in a browser localhost:8890

Regarding Jupyter notebooks it is recommended to started with a password since it is a share server and anybody that has access to the server will have access to your Jupyter notebooks.

Can put a password easily doing:

`jupyter notebook password`


For version control of jupyter notebooks:

[nbdime](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime)

### Jupyter Hub and Kernels

Since version 4.1.0, anaconda includes a special package nb_conda_kernels that detects conda environments with notebook kernels and automatically registers them. This makes using a new python version as easy as creating new conda environments.


### wget with Jupyter

From this answer in stack overflow [Retrieving files from remote IPython notebook server?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24437661/retrieving-files-from-remote-ipython-notebook-server):

```python
from IPython.display import FileLink, FileLinks
FileLinks('.') #lists all downloadable files on server
```
The code generates links to download files


For version control 

### Github repos

#### Data Reduction Scripts

This repository includes all the custom scripts used. The idea is to avoid manual data-manipulation whenever possible and have everything under version control. The repo is at [https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/VIMOSReduced](https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/VIMOSReduced%5D)

Github has a limit on the files uploaded to for the larger files like the .fits file created I have a temporary HTTP server to share any relevant files. It is explain in the [HTTP server](#http) section below.

#### Docker file

The [vimos docker repo](https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/VIMOSDocker) includes the Dockerfile for a image with Anaconda (or miniconda)(based on Python 3.5) of Scientific Linux 7.2\. It can be manually build or the build image can be found on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/manuelmarcano22/vimosdocker/).

Explantation about Docker and containers, as well as some reasons why I will try to use docker containers are explain in my next entry [here](/VIMOSlabbook16/log/2016/11/26/docker-containers.html).

#### This notebook

This “lab notebook” is also it’s own git repository on github. The source can be found at [https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/VIMOSlabbook16](https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/VIMOSlabbook16)

Next step is to have the notebook as a docker container.

### HTTP server

A temporary HTTP server can be found at [transfer.manuelpm.me](http://transfer.manuelpm.me/). So far it includes the provided .tar.gz file with the relevant fits and scripts. To download the tar files provided by Dr. Torres one can use wget:

`wget http://transfer.manuelpm.me/to-manuel.tar.gz`

To get the file with only the fits do

`wget http://transfer.manuelpm.me/to-manuel-fits.tar.gz`

For the current fits:

`wget http://transfer.manuelpm.me/current-fits.tar.gz`

I was playing with the idea to have instead a ftp server, but since I have already Apache running on my [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) I didn’t see any big advantages of having it only the ftp server. I should ask around.

### Docker Container

See [here](/VIMOSlabbook16/log/2016/11/26/docker-containers.html)


# VIM

Had to install VIM from souce in krieger. Dowload it from Github. Just had the trouble that in the directory had to include the file /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt in ./local/share/vim

And from the /usr/share/vim/vim/vim74 had to copy all the colors and syntax to ./local/share/vim
