### CX0025

From faq in [http://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=139857](http://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=139857)


> Hello,The usual way to extract 1D spectra from 2D data is with the twodspec.apextract package. Admittedly this is a fairly sophisticated package with lots to learn for the novice. But it may be good for you to learn about it and look over the documents of spectral reductions in the docs area of the iraf.net site.The simplest way to do a simple column or line sum of a 2D spectrum is with the task SCOPY in the ONEDSPEC package.[code:1:f2c01fead5] <br/r>
cl> onedspec <br/r>
cl> onedspec.dispaxis=2 # 1=spectrum along rows, 2=spectrum along cols<br/r>
cl> onedspec.nsum=10 # Number of rows/columns to sum<br/r>
cl> scopy spec2d spec1d aper=50<br/r>
In the ONEDSPEC package tasks which work on 1D spectra automatically convert 2D spectra using dispaxis, nsum, and aperture. The "aperture" parameter is the row or column in the 2D spectrum which is the center of the spectrum you want to extract. Note that instead of using SCOPY you could use SPLOT to do the conversion internally and get a graph of the spectrum.<br/r>

### Ipython

To create a new fits with only the source with python do:

Looks like:

![Only source CX25]({{site.baseurl}}/images/newcx25.png)


created with:

```python
from astropy.io import fits
original = fits.open('VI_SSEM_577734_2011-06-24T05:56:42.518_G475_MR_402230_Q4_hi.')
fits.writeto('newcx25.fits',original[0].data[30:180,:] ,original[0].header) 
```

## CX0059

For CX0059 the SRFM was an automatically extrated. To see it use `splot`.

The spectra looks like:
