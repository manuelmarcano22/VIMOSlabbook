### SRFM and Pre-image

Only one source. In the SEXM it seems that there are a total of 8 "sections" or slit. The bigger one (4th from top to bottom) is the relevant one with the source. There seems to be three apertures there. This is in agreement with what is shown in the pre-image. One very near the end of the slit, then one very bright and a third fainter one. From right to left the black sources (according to the preimage astrometry) are located at:

* $\alpha$ 17:51:35.2  $\delta$  -28:43:47.18
* $\alpha$ 17:51:35.2  $\delta$  -28:43:42.18
* $\alpha$ 17:51:35.2  $\delta$  -28:43:34.18

## Information

From the [GBS X-ray source list](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJS/194/18). Info on Cx 65 also called [CXOGBS J175135.2-284345](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-5?-ref=VIZ5882891704be&-out.add=.&-source=J/ApJS/194/18/table3&recno=65) with a total of **24 counts**.

From [Simbad](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%409738333&Name=OGLE%20BLG500.13%20%2014897&submit=submit) it is a Variable of **RS CVn type** also called  **OGLE BLG500.13 14897 **. Cited in a paper about optical counterpats to X-ray sources in the Galactic Bulge  [@OGLEUdalski2012].


#### RS CVn stars

Named after the prototype system RS CVn proposed by [@Hall1976]. Some characteristics :

- Close detached binaries with a G-K ro subgiant and as secondary dwarf G to M
- Strong chromospheric activitty and coronal X-ray emission
- Ca II H and K lines. (this are out of range for me)

Citing page 274 [@SpectralClassBook]

> Ca II H & K lines, often H$\alpha$ also. Stron Mg II lines at 280 nm and lines at 120 and 190 nm. The **overall spectral morphology is of an early-G**, slightly evolved star.  


## Apertures

Looking at the apertures I assume there are 10 different ones. In the figure the relevant slit begins around 129 to 200 (y). These ones are marked as 11, 7 and 12 in the picture below. The order of the polynomial for the trace is 13.
